                        there's no good budgeting app that is free and can connect to bank accounts while also allowing for budgeting within the app. 
                        {Mint Intuit used to be the app for this, but they got bought out by CreditKarma and no longer exist.} 
                        Budgeting shouldn't take money to have access to a simple software that can help manage money.

                    In today's digital age, many individuals spend long hours in front of screens, often becoming so immersed in their work or entertainment that they neglect essential daily tasks—such as taking medication. 
                    Traditional reminders, like phone alarms or notifications, can be easily ignored or dismissed. 
                    There is a need for a more engaging and persistent reminder system that ensures users can get their IRL tasks done as well.

                My findings show that there are similar apps on the market, but nothing quite like it. 
                The similar apps are either visual alarms or productivity tools to keep you on track. 
                <br><br>
                There are many reminder and productivity apps, each catering to different user needs. Some focus on reducing distractions, others on quick task input, and some emphasize mindfulness or structured organization. While these apps help users stay on track, most rely on passive notifications that can be easily dismissed, making them less effective for users who need a more forceful approach to reminders.
                <br><br>
                Among them, Focus Bear offers distraction-blocking and scheduled focus sessions, while Opal helps limit screen time. Remind Me Faster is designed for quick and efficient reminder creation, Mindr - Mindful Reminders provides gentle nudges, and Twos blends note-taking with task management. However, none of these apps focus on delivering an unavoidable, assertive reminder system that forces users to take action—leaving a gap for a solution that ensures important tasks, like taking medication, aren’t ignored.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <em>19 February 2025</em>

                <em>
                    Problem Identification & Research Plan
                </em>
                <br>
    
                At first, the problem appeared straightforward— people struggling to manage their time effectively. Alarms blare but are silenced. Notifications appear but are ignored. To do lists fill up but remain incomplete. This wasn’t just procrastination; it was a failure in the very design of reminder systems {or willpower}. I developed a structured yet adaptable research plan, focusing on real user behavior through casual conversations and open-ended interviews. I sought to uncover the patterns behind why people acknowledge but fail to act on reminders and how they could better accomplish their tasks.
                
                <br><br>
                <em>
                    Key Insights
                </em>
                <br>
    
                The research revealed a complex interaction between avoidance, motivation, and accountability. People ignore reminders because there is no immediate consequence; the future self bears the burden, not the present one. Many interviewees admitted they were more likely to complete tasks when external accountability was in place—whether through deadlines, social pressure, or necessity, such as running out of clean clothes.
    
                Another major insight was the role of screen immersion. Many users reported losing track of time due to prolonged screen engagement, often delaying real-world responsibilities. This suggested that an effective reminder system would need to interrupt this immersion in a way that commands attention but does not feel overly restrictive.
    
                Despite the desire for stricter systems, users still valued flexibility. While some wanted forceful reminders like screen locks, others preferred softer nudges—reminders that included reasons or incentives to act, such as emphasizing potential regret. The goal was clear: an effective system must balance enforcement with user autonomy, creating a structure that encourages adherence rather than rebellion.
    
                <br><br>
                <em>
                    Challenges & Surprises
                </em>
                <br>
    
                A key challenge was addressing users' resistance to control. Even those who requested forceful interventions admitted they would likely try to bypass them. This suggested that a purely restrictive approach would be ineffective. Instead, a persuasive and engaging system—one that users opt into rather than feel confined by—would be more successful.
    
                Another unexpected finding was the role of entertainment as a motivator. One user stated they would be more likely to complete tasks if they could simultaneously engage in passive entertainment, such as listening to music or watching a show. This indicated that an ideal system should integrate task completion with enjoyable elements rather than rely solely on disruption and restriction.
    
                <br><br>
                <em>
                    Market & Solution Understanding
                </em>
                <br>
    
                Initially, I assumed the market for productivity tools was saturated. However, my research highlighted a critical gap: existing tools assume users will naturally follow through once reminded. They fail to address underlying avoidance behaviors. The key differentiator for a successful solution is not just issuing reminders but actively countering resistance and procrastination.
    
                An effective solution must go beyond simple task management—it must be behavioral and immersive. This could involve gamification, structured incentives, or even a system that acknowledges avoidance and counteracts it with engagement strategies. A system that says, I know you want to ignore this, but here’s why you shouldn’t, rather than just presenting another dismissible notification.
    
                <br><br>
                <em>
                    Personal Learning & Feedback
                </em>
                <br>
    
                This research deepened my understanding of human behavior, particularly the diverse ways individuals respond to motivation and accountability. Some thrive under strict structures, while others require more adaptable systems. Recognizing these varying needs reinforced the importance of designing solutions that cater to different behavioral tendencies rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach.
    
                The most challenging aspect was distilling the wide range of user feedback into clear, actionable insights. Moving forward, I want to explore how technology can subtly influence human behavior for positive outcomes—how motivation can be nurtured rather than imposed. The balance between guidance and control is delicate, but within it lies the potential for a truly effective solution.

                            <li>
                                Recurring reminders: Make it easy to set up daily, weekly, or custom recurring reminders.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Empathetic messaging: Use encouraging and positive language in reminders (e.g., "You've got this!" instead of "Don't forget!").

                            <li>
                                Mental health breaks: Include features like "pause mode" for users feeling overwhelmed.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                    <li>
                        How might we integrate limited snoozing options while still having forceful reminders?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Snooze limits: Allow only a set number of snoozes per reminder (e.g., 2-3 times).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Increasing urgency: Make snoozed reminders more persistent (e.g., louder, more frequent, or harder to dismiss).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Snooze with a purpose: Require users to specify a reason for snoozing (e.g., "I'm busy" or "I need more time").
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pre-snooze commitment: Ask users to commit to a specific time for the next reminder when they snooze.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Post-snooze action: After snoozing, require users to take a small step toward completing the task (e.g., "Spend 1 minute planning this task").
                            </li>

                <em>
                    Defining a Focused Point of View
                </em> <br>
                My initial assumption that the problem centered around forgetfulness was quickly challenged through user research. 
                What emerged was a more nuanced understanding of human behavior - we don't just forget tasks, we consciously postpone them. 
                The key insight wasn't about memory failure, but about motivation failure. 
                People described a familiar cycle: setting reminders with good intentions, then developing what one user called "notification blindness" - the ability to see yet ignore alerts. 
                This revelation fundamentally shifted my approach from creating better reminders to designing better engagement. 
                I realized the solution needed to address the psychological gap between intention and action, not just the technological gap between alert and response. 
                This deeper understanding helped me focus on designing for behavioral change rather than simple task management.
                <br><br>
                
                <em>
                    Generating Ideas with How Might We
                </em> <br>
                The "How Might We" framework proved invaluable in expanding my thinking beyond conventional solutions. 
                By reframing challenges as opportunities, I was able to explore more creative avenues. 
                "How might we make acting on reminders more rewarding than ignoring them?" led me to investigate micro-rewards and progress visualization. 
                "How might we create gentle accountability?" sparked ideas about social commitment devices. 
                Most importantly, "How might we design for resistance rather than assuming compliance?" helped me develop features that acknowledge human nature rather than fight against it. 
                This structured yet open-ended approach prevented me from settling on obvious solutions and pushed me to consider more human-centered approaches that address root causes rather than symptoms.
                <br><br>
                
                <em>
                    Establishing Core Values & Principles
                </em> <br>
                Through this process, three core principles emerged that guided all subsequent decisions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Empathy over enforcement: 
                        <br>
                        Recognizing that people want to complete tasks but often face invisible barriers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flexible structure: 
                        <br>
                        Building systems that adapt to real human behavior rather than demanding perfect compliance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Respectful persistence: 
                        <br> 
                        Creating reminders that work without being oppressive
                    </li>
                </ol>
                These principles served as a compass throughout development. 
                For instance, when considering a "lock screen until task complete" feature, the empathy principle helped me recognize this would likely create resentment rather than results. 
                Instead, I focused on opt-in accountability systems that users would willingly engage with.
                <br><br>
                
                <em>
                    Prioritizing Key Features
                </em> <br>
                The ideation phase generated an abundance of possibilities, requiring difficult but necessary prioritization. 
                I developed a simple framework to evaluate features:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Impact: How directly does this address the core problem?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Usability: Will people actually use this consistently?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment: Does this fit with our core principles?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Features like customizable reminder escalation and progress streaks scored highly, while more complex solutions like AI-powered scheduling were deprioritized. 
                The most challenging trade-off was abandoning a "smart skip" function - while technologically impressive, user feedback suggested it would undermine the accountability the system aimed to create. 
                This process taught me that good design often means saying no to good ideas in service of great ones.

                <em>
                    Lessons & Next Steps
                </em> <br>
                This ideation process fundamentally changed how I approach design problems. 
                Key takeaways include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Behavioral insights trump technical features: The most elegant solution fails if it doesn't account for human psychology
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Constraints breed creativity: The "How Might We" framework showed me how limitations can spark better ideas
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Principles prevent drift: Having clear values prevented feature creep and kept the solution focused
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Moving forward, I'm particularly interested in exploring:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The role of variable rewards in habit formation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing for different motivation styles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The psychology of commitment devices
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Perhaps most importantly, I learned that effective design sits at the intersection of understanding and ingenuity - knowing both what people need and how to deliver it in ways they'll embrace. 
                This mindset will inform all my future work, reminding me that technology serves behavior, not the other way around. 
                The next phase will focus on prototyping these insights into tangible experiences that feel less like tools and more like trusted partners in productivity.

                    Design Process: Building on Research Insights
                </em> <br>
                The design phase began by translating key research findings into tangible solutions. Starting with simple wireframes, I focused on the three most frequent user pain points: ignored reminders, screen immersion, and resistance to control. Early concepts tested different interruption methods, eventually converging on the screen freeze approach after observing how users responded to forced pauses during testing. High-fidelity mockups refined the visual language to match the playful-but-persistent personality participants preferred.

                </em><br>
                Every design decision tied directly to research insights:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The red/orange/yellow color system emerged from users associating red with urgency during interviews

                </em> <br>
                Using Figma for wireframing and prototyping allowed quick iteration based on user feedback. The biggest challenge was balancing interruption effectiveness with user autonomy - early versions felt too disruptive. Solving this involved:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adding gradual escalation (visual cue → dimming → full freeze)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Incorporating the emergency bypass option
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allowing customizable freeze durations
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>

                User testing revealed crucial adjustments:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The original "strict mode" language felt judgmental → changed to "focus mode"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some testers didn't immediately understand settings choices → added introductory tooltips
                    </li>
                    <!-- <li>
                        Colorblind participants suggested supplemental cues → incorporated position-based ordering
                    </li> -->
                </ul>
                <br><br>

                    <li>
                        How different user types respond to various enforcement levels

                <!-- The most valuable lesson was that effective design solutions emerged only when I stopped assuming and started listening.  -->
                Each pivot - from visual design to interaction patterns - was driven by specific user quotes and behaviors observed during research. 
                What began as a technical challenge (better reminders) became a human one: how to create helpful friction without breeding resentment.
