                        Encourages stamp sending, build a collection without have physical bulk (for ex: I live in nyc with no space for anything, but I'd still love to hold memories). 
                        There can be a space for notes when you click in to each collected stamp.

                        <br>
                        there's no good budgeting app that is free and can connect to bank accounts while also allowing for budgeting within the app. 
                        (Mint Intuit used to be the app for this, but they got bought out by CreditKarma and no longer exist.) 
                        Budgeting shouldn't take money to have access to a simple software that can help manage money.

                        <br>
                        Users can take a picture of whatever prints they collect to make a digital archive of and from that point on can refer to from anywhere instead of needed to dig through flat files and folders for specific prints.

                        A desktop buddy "I'm freezing your screen until you take your meds!! grrrrrr!!" 
                        Because people are always on screens doing work and such, a little buddy to help with your life (just a little)!
                        A different kind of alert system.
