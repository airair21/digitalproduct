                        there's no good budgeting app that is free and can connect to bank accounts while also allowing for budgeting within the app. 
                        (Mint Intuit used to be the app for this, but they got bought out by CreditKarma and no longer exist.) 
                        Budgeting shouldn't take money to have access to a simple software that can help manage money.

                    In today's digital age, many individuals spend long hours in front of screens, often becoming so immersed in their work or entertainment that they neglect essential daily tasks—such as taking medication. 
                    Traditional reminders, like phone alarms or notifications, can be easily ignored or dismissed. 
                    There is a need for a more engaging and persistent reminder system that ensures users can get their IRL tasks done as well.

                        My user is someone who alarms and reminders never work for. 
                        <br>
                        Probably young adult to adult. Someone who uses screens heavily, usually at home.

                        The user's environment would be screen-centered, always doing work on a screen or interacting with a screen (preferably a desk- or laptop).

                        The user would use this product because regular alarms and reminders can be easily ignored, whereas this product would pause the screen they would be on to allow the user to leave the screen momentarily and accomplish whatever task they set a reminder for.

                        A user might begrudingly do what the alarm buddy is reminding them to do, but they would be thankful in the end that they accomplished their task.

                My findings show that there are similar apps on the market, but nothing quite like it. 
                The similar apps are either visual alarms or productivity tools to keep you on track. 
                <br><br>
                There are many reminder and productivity apps, each catering to different user needs. Some focus on reducing distractions, others on quick task input, and some emphasize mindfulness or structured organization. While these apps help users stay on track, most rely on passive notifications that can be easily dismissed, making them less effective for users who need a more forceful approach to reminders.
                <br><br>
                Among them, Focus Bear offers distraction-blocking and scheduled focus sessions, while Opal helps limit screen time. Remind Me Faster is designed for quick and efficient reminder creation, Mindr - Mindful Reminders provides gentle nudges, and Twos blends note-taking with task management. However, none of these apps focus on delivering an unavoidable, assertive reminder system that forces users to take action—leaving a gap for a solution that ensures important tasks, like taking medication, aren’t ignored.
