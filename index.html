                        there's no good budgeting app that is free and can connect to bank accounts while also allowing for budgeting within the app. 
                        (Mint Intuit used to be the app for this, but they got bought out by CreditKarma and no longer exist.) 
                        Budgeting shouldn't take money to have access to a simple software that can help manage money.

                    In today's digital age, many individuals spend long hours in front of screens, often becoming so immersed in their work or entertainment that they neglect essential daily tasks—such as taking medication. 
                    Traditional reminders, like phone alarms or notifications, can be easily ignored or dismissed. 
                    There is a need for a more engaging and persistent reminder system that ensures users can get their IRL tasks done as well.

                My findings show that there are similar apps on the market, but nothing quite like it. 
                The similar apps are either visual alarms or productivity tools to keep you on track. 
                <br><br>
                There are many reminder and productivity apps, each catering to different user needs. Some focus on reducing distractions, others on quick task input, and some emphasize mindfulness or structured organization. While these apps help users stay on track, most rely on passive notifications that can be easily dismissed, making them less effective for users who need a more forceful approach to reminders.
                <br><br>
                Among them, Focus Bear offers distraction-blocking and scheduled focus sessions, while Opal helps limit screen time. Remind Me Faster is designed for quick and efficient reminder creation, Mindr - Mindful Reminders provides gentle nudges, and Twos blends note-taking with task management. However, none of these apps focus on delivering an unavoidable, assertive reminder system that forces users to take action—leaving a gap for a solution that ensures important tasks, like taking medication, aren’t ignored.

                Problem Identification & Research Plan
            </em>
            <br>

            At first, the problem appeared straightforward— people struggling to manage their time effectively. Alarms blare but are silenced. Notifications appear but are ignored. To do lists fill up but remain incomplete. This wasn’t just procrastination; it was a failure in the very design of reminder systems (or willpower). I developed a structured yet adaptable research plan, focusing on real user behavior through casual conversations and open-ended interviews. I sought to uncover the patterns behind why people acknowledge but fail to act on reminders and how they could better accomplish their tasks.

            <em>
                Key Insights
            </em>
            <br>

            The research revealed a complex interaction between avoidance, motivation, and accountability. People ignore reminders because there is no immediate consequence; the future self bears the burden, not the present one. Many interviewees admitted they were more likely to complete tasks when external accountability was in place—whether through deadlines, social pressure, or necessity, such as running out of clean clothes.

            Another major insight was the role of screen immersion. Many users reported losing track of time due to prolonged screen engagement, often delaying real-world responsibilities. This suggested that an effective reminder system would need to interrupt this immersion in a way that commands attention but does not feel overly restrictive.

            Despite the desire for stricter systems, users still valued flexibility. While some wanted forceful reminders like screen locks, others preferred softer nudges—reminders that included reasons or incentives to act, such as emphasizing potential regret. The goal was clear: an effective system must balance enforcement with user autonomy, creating a structure that encourages adherence rather than rebellion.

            <em>
                Challenges & Surprises
            </em>
            <br>

            A key challenge was addressing users' resistance to control. Even those who requested forceful interventions admitted they would likely try to bypass them. This suggested that a purely restrictive approach would be ineffective. Instead, a persuasive and engaging system—one that users opt into rather than feel confined by—would be more successful.

            Another unexpected finding was the role of entertainment as a motivator. One user stated they would be more likely to complete tasks if they could simultaneously engage in passive entertainment, such as listening to music or watching a show. This indicated that an ideal system should integrate task completion with enjoyable elements rather than rely solely on disruption and restriction.

            <em>
                Market & Solution Understanding
            </em>
            <br>

            Initially, I assumed the market for productivity tools was saturated. However, my research highlighted a critical gap: existing tools assume users will naturally follow through once reminded. They fail to address underlying avoidance behaviors. The key differentiator for a successful solution is not just issuing reminders but actively countering resistance and procrastination.

            An effective solution must go beyond simple task management—it must be behavioral and immersive. This could involve gamification, structured incentives, or even a system that acknowledges avoidance and counteracts it with engagement strategies. A system that says, I know you want to ignore this, but here’s why you shouldn’t, rather than just presenting another dismissible notification.

                Personal Learning & Feedback
            </em>
            <br>

            This research deepened my understanding of human behavior, particularly the diverse ways individuals respond to motivation and accountability. Some thrive under strict structures, while others require more adaptable systems. Recognizing these varying needs reinforced the importance of designing solutions that cater to different behavioral tendencies rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach.

            The most challenging aspect was distilling the wide range of user feedback into clear, actionable insights. Moving forward, I want to explore how technology can subtly influence human behavior for positive outcomes—how motivation can be nurtured rather than imposed. The balance between guidance and control is delicate, but within it lies the potential for a truly effective solution.
