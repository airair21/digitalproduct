                        Encourages stamp sending, build a collection without have physical bulk (for ex: I live in nyc with no space for anything, but I'd still love to hold memories). 
                        There can be a space for notes when you click in to each collected stamp.

                        <br>
                        there's no good budgeting app that is free and can connect to bank accounts while also allowing for budgeting within the app. 
                        (Mint Intuit used to be the app for this, but they got bought out by CreditKarma and no longer exist.) 
                        Budgeting shouldn't take money to have access to a simple software that can help manage money.

                The user's environment would be screen-centered, always doing work on a screen or interacting with a screen (preferably a desk- or laptop).
                The user would use this product because regular alarms and reminders can be easily ignored, whereas this product would pause the screen they would be on to allow the user to leave the screen momentarily and accomplish whatever task they set a reminder for. 
                The user feels momentarily annoyed, because their screen is no longer useable, but they would also feel 
                A user might begrudingly do what the alarm buddy is reminding them to do, but they would be thankful in the end that they accomplished their task.
